Don't be so sure.\r\n\r\n> Is bitcoin anonymous? The answer is yes, if you make some effort,\r\n and no, if you don’t.\r\n\r\n> Bitcoin is unique, in that it is one of the most transparent,\r\n and yet opaque, systems for monetary transactions available.\r\n\r\n> The bottom line is that bitcoin is ‘quasi-anonymous’.\r\n You can certainly hide your activities in the network, but if\r\n  you get it wrong, then the stakes are high: you may be more\r\n   visible than you ever would’ve been when simply using cash.\r\n\r\n#### [Bitcoin developer chats about regulation, open source, and the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2039184/bitcoin-developer-talks-regulation-open-source-and-the-elusive-satoshi-nakamoto.html) | May 2013\r\n\r\n> IDGNS: Can Bitcoin transactions be completely anonymous?\r\n\r\n> Garzik: The stock answer is no, it's pseudo-anonymous,\r\n sort of like a Swiss bank account, it's a number.\r\n  But if you go through a lot of effort it can be anonymous.\r\n\r\n> IDGNS: Isn't the anonymity and inability to trace transactions one\r\n of the things that worries the federal government?\r\n\r\n> Garzik:That's the big thing with licensing the bitcoin exchanges,\r\nif you can regulate that gateway\r\n then you have a good chance of attacking the problem directly.\r\n\r\n#### [More Privacy Vulnerabilities in Bitcoin](https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/more-privacy-vulnerabilities-in-bitcoin/) | May 2013\r\n\r\n> I privately disclose these problems [with privacy] with the core dev team,\r\nbut apparently they think they shouldn’t solve these kind of privacy issues,\r\nsince it’s not worth the trouble.\r\n\r\n> Gavin has many times said he is waiting for someone\r\nto build an anonymization layer on top of Bitcoin, so\r\n the privacy problem magically goes away.\r\n\r\n> I want to alert Bitcoin users that Bitcoin privacy is still weak.\r\n\r\n#### [Silk Road investigators charged with stealing bitcoin during probe ](http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2015/0331/Silk-Road-investigators-charged-with-stealing-bitcoin-during-probe) | Mar 2015\r\n\r\n> The peer-to-peer electronic payment system that bypasses banks,\r\n  is not anonymous.

LOL](http://christophercantwell.com/2014/03/26/thought-bitcoin-end-state-lol/) | Mar 2013\r\n\r\n> Bitcoin is not untraceable.\r\n\r\n> Bitcoin is more traceable than traditional banking,\r\nwhere the transaction information is at least hidden from public view.\r\n\r\n> On the other hand, the moment the government decides it wants to bust you,\r\n they will, and all the information they need to do it will be publicly\r\n listed on the internet for all to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Bitcoin is not (entirely) anonymous.\r\n\r\n#### [FBI fears Bitcoin’s popularity with criminals](http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2012/05/fbi-fears-bitcoins-popularity-with-criminals/) | May 2012\r\n\r\n> Bitcoin transactions are published online, but the only information\r\n that identifies a Bitcoin user is a Bitcoin address,\r\n  making the transaction anonymous.

With casual usage, it is not very anonymous at all.\r\n\r\n> Bitcoin transactions can be traced back to your IP address.\r\n The history of all transactions can be analyzed for spatial and\r\n  temporal correlations. If one address can be linked to a person,\r\n   then related transactions can be identified.\r\n\r\n> And, you have to know what you're doing to use\r\n it in complete anonymity.

Now Fergal Reid and Martin Harrigan of University College Dublin,\r\n    Ireland, say this assumption is wrong.\r\n\r\n> most casual users of Bitcoin may not be anonymous, even though many\r\n of them may believe they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### [Technology](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/cs181/projects/2010-11/DigitalCurrencies/technology/index.html) | Apr 2011\r\n\r\n> Bitcoin addresses contain no personal information attached to it, and are somewhat anonymous.\r\nHowever, it is still possible to track a user using transaction history, which is public to all users.\r\n\r\n> If an address is connected to a user, it is possible to trace the series of transactions, and subsequently, track the user.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### [Anonymity](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=241.0) | Jul 2010\r\n\r\n> The current BitCoin implementation is certainly\r\nbetter than using a credit card,\r\nbut I wouldn't use it in environments requiring strong\r\n anonymity without a lot of changes.\r\n\r\n> The history of a coin is publicly available.\r\n Anyone can see the flow of BitCoins from address to address. This becomes a problem\r\n  when certain points in the \"transaction chain\"\r\n   become known to the attacker.\r\n\r\n#### [Repost: How anonymous are bitcoins?](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=8.0) | Nov 2009\r\n\r\n> The possibility to be anonymous or pseudonymous\r\nrelies on you not revealing any identifying information\r\nabout yourself in connection with the bitcoin addresses you use.\r\n\r\n> If you post your bitcoin address on the web,\r\n then you're associating that address and any transactions\r\n with it with the name you posted under.\r\n  If you posted under a handle that you haven't\r\n   associated with your real identity, then you're still pseudonymous.\r\n\r\n## Possible solutions\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of possible solutions to the anonymity and privacy issues\r\nin Bitcoin.
