# Bitcion is NOT anonymous

There appears to be a massive misconception that Bitcoin is somehow
anonymous, and it is the best payment method for those
wanting to protect their privacy and anonymity when paying
for products and services with Bitcoin. Well, it is not!

Seeing how this misconception is popular and
widespread among Bitcoiners and services accepting this cryptocurrency,
the following list of quotes (with links to their sources)
about Bitcoin anononymity and privacy was prepared.

The quotes, as being the only extracts from the linked articles,
can often be out of contents. So I encourage everyone to read the linked
 resources from which the quotes were taken to get complete
 information and understanding of the context.
 Please read and draw your own conclusions. The aim of this page is
 to aggregate these links and quotes in one place. Its not for
 analyzing them, or defending them or dismissing them. So take it for
 what it is. Up to you.

 The list was only prepared to get you started thinking and doing
 your own research about Bitcoin's limitations in terms of
  privacy and anonymity.  If you don't care about privacy and anonymity
  of your transactions, or the privacy and anonymity of
 people who you exchange bitcoins with, than its obviously not for you.

I start with the official links and quotes from
 bitcoin.org on this topic.  Then other sources are provided.
 Finally, I finish with links to
 possible solutions to this problem.

#### [Some things you need to know](https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy)

> Bitcoin is not anonymous

> All Bitcoin transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network,
which means anyone can see the balance and transactions of any Bitcoin address.

#### [Protect your privacy](https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy)

> Bitcoin is probably the most transparent payment network in the world.

> All Bitcoin transactions are public, traceable, and permanently stored in the Bitcoin network.

> Anyone can see the balance and all transactions of any address.

### [Is Bitcoin anonymous?](https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#is-bitcoin-anonymous)

> Bitcoin is not anonymous and cannot offer the same level of privacy as cash.

> The use of Bitcoin leaves extensive public records.

#### [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

> The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the
parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly
precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in
another place: by keeping public keys anonymous.

> The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to
the same owner.

> Every time someone makes a transaction with Bitcoin, a record of that transaction immediately shows up in the Blockchain. As a result, it is always possible to see where digital currency came from and where it went.

> According to the recent reports – two companies, Chainalysis and Elliptic,

> Bitcoin is more susceptible to tracing than paper money.

> While the ownership of the wallets is anonymous, the ledger is public.

> This ledger has a full and easily viewable history of all transactions
 that have ever occurred and will ever occur on the Bitcoin network.
  Consequently, unlike paper currency, which can disappear and
   reappear with no record of transfer or trace of exchange, every
    single Bitcoin transaction is available for all the world to see
     and cannot be hidden, or obscured or changed.

> While Bitcoin does not instantly reveal who
 owns the accounts on either end (the wallets),
  the transactions are recorded, and recorded on a very public ledger.

> Consequently, contrary to what many people believe
law enforcement is in a better position when criminals use Bitcoin
 than they are when criminals use paper currency.

> Bitcoin is the most transparent payment method ever invented and has the potential to become a powerful tool in the fight against money laundering.

> So bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous, recording your bitcoin address (or pseudonym) but not your identity. However, in many cases identities can be linked to bitcoin addresses.

#### [Privacy and Fungibility Roundtable at Consensus 2015](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/scalingbitcoin/privacy-and-fungibility/) | Sep 2015

> It’s important to bear in mind that Bitcoin isn’t anonymous.
On the contrary, all transactions between Bitcoin addresses are permanently
 stored in the blockchain and open to analysis. Therefore, even though Bitcoin
 addresses aren’t explicitly associated to personal identities,
  sophisticated network analysis can permit de-anonymizing users and
   reporting them to the authorities if they violate applicable regulations.

> one of the biggest eyebrow raisers of sceptics was the misconception that
Bitcoin is an anonymous cryptocurrency and that it will serve best those
 individuals who wish to hide their transactions, licit or otherwise.

> Bitcoin in itself is anything but anonymous.
Each and every transaction conducted has to be verified by the
 network of miners, and for the sake of transparency, each and every
  transaction can be tracked on Bitcoin’s public ledger.

#### [Improve transaction privacy / fungibility in Bitcoin Core and the Bitcoin system](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6568) | Aug 2015

> Financial privacy is an essential property of every monetary
 and payment system. Without it the user's security is
  reduced due to targeted attacks, the freedom to associate and transact
   is limited, and their commercial interests may be compromised
    when competition can monitor their activity.

> The importance of privacy was recognized in the original Bitcoin whitepaper,
 but the only approach available at the time (pseudonymous addresses)
  provides only limited privacy and what it does provide is highly brittle.

#### [Mixing Services Compound Bitcoin’s PR Problem](http://bitcoinist.net/mixing-services-compound-bitcoins-pr-problem/) | Aug 2015

> Many people are drawn to Bitcoin and virtual currencies for the
 illusion of being able to move funds around in an
  anonymous way. However, with the blockchain acting
   as a transparent ledger, there is no such
    thing as anonymity in the Bitcoin space.

> most people see the virtual currency as a safe haven
 for money laundering, fraud, and illegal trading.
 Such a train of thought is quite odd, as Bitcoin
 is not anonymous and is one of the worst possible
 options to launder money.

#### [Bitcoin: Questions, Answers, and Analysis of Legal Issues](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43339.pdf) | Aug 2015

> Bitcoin transactions are not truly anonymous.

> A full transaction record of every Bitcoin and every Bitcoin user’s
 encrypted identity is maintained on the public ledger.

> Because of the public ledger, researchers have found that,
using sophisticated computer analysis, transactions
 involving large quantities of Bitcoin can be tracked
  and claim that if paired with current law enforcement tools it
   would be possible to gain a lot of information on the persons
moving the Bitcoins.

> Bitcoin exchanges will be required to collect
personal data on their customers, limiting further the system’s
 ability to maintain the user’s pseudonymity.

> Bitcoin transactions do not have the anonymity afforded by
 cash transactions, as there is a permanent and complete historical
 record of Bitcoin amounts and encrypted identities for all
 transactions on the Bitcoin system that are potentially traceable.

#### [Anonymous Payment Methods](http://www.cogipas.com/anonymous-payment-methods/) | Jun 2015

> Are Bitcoins Anonymous? Well, the answer is yes and no.
Strictly speaking, Bitcoin payments can be traced
 through the chain of transactions that remain stamped
  on the currency. Each Bitcoin keeps a record of
   the transactions it was used in, called a
    “block chain”, which includes IP address information from
     these transactions.

> While there are methods for “cleaning” Bitcoins to make them
 nearly anonymous, these methods are complicated.

> Although it is possible to acquire Bitcoins
 without a bank account, the steps involved add
  further hassle and relying on (yet more) third parties.

> Blockstream Co-Founder and Bitcoin Core Developer Greg Maxwell mentioned
how he wouldn’t want to live in a bitcoin world if privacy were not improved.

> Once you pay someone, they know who you are because you transacted with them.
 They can look at your transaction history to make a good guess at what your
 financial history is. You can leak this information to everyone, and
 they just have to attach your name to one address [to] get all of the other details.

> When we ask institutions about using bitcoin, even the
 most boring institutions look at this
 and say, "We don’t want to use all of our transactions in public."

> In many instances, the financial privacy of the legacy
  banking system is preferred over bitcoin.

> When dealing with a centralized financial institution, one’s transaction history
is at least kept private (in theory) from everyone other than the bank and the customer.

> And a loss of privacy loses fungibility, and that’s an
inherent property of money. If each bitcoin has a history
 and people know how it’s used, then maybe some people won’t want some bitcoin


#### [Bitcoin is not anonymous](https://www.elliptic.co/bitcoin-is-not-anonymous/) | June 2015

> Bitcoin transactions are anything but anonymous.

> Bitcoin therefore provides the ultimate paper trail for law enforcement agencies, tax authorities and compliance professionals.

> This also has serious implications for user privacy – we are
 on the whole comfortable with entrusting our financial information with
 banks, but opening up this transaction history for all to
 see on the block chain may be too much for many.

> A lack of privacy in bitcoin transactions is a threat to
 fungibility because users could decide not to accept “tainted”
 coins that may have been stolen or come from some sort of criminal operation.

 has the same access to the master ledger as any other
  person anyone else in the world. This ledger has a full
   and easily viewable history of all transactions that have ever occurred and
    will ever occur on the Bitcoin network.
    Consequently, unlike paper currency, which can disappear and
     reappear with no record of transfer or trace of exchange, every single Bitcoin
      transaction is available for all the world to see and cannot be hidden,
       or obscured or changed.

But it may also have the potential
to help government monitor how people spend money.

> There is at least one private company - Coin Validation - that want
to make use of the public Bitcoin ledger to create a centralized tracking
 system linking real identities with associated Bitcoin addresses.

> It is not as good for that purpose as a fully anonymous currency would be,

> Transactions are shown as between accounts, not between people. But all that is necessary to link a realspace person to at least one of his accounts is to make a bitcoin payment to him and see what account the money goes to.

> That works as a way of monitoring bitcoin transactions made by a realspace identity.

#### [Is Bitcoin Anonymous?](http://bitcoin.cex.io/is-bitcoin-anonymous/) | Aug 2014

> While the digital currency can be used in a private and secure manner,
 it is definitely not anonymous by default.

> Bitcoin was created to solve the problem of censorship resistance
more than anonymity in finance

> The fact that every Bitcoin user needs to be tracked whenever
 they make a purchase is basically an admittance from most
  governments that there is no such thing as financial privacy.
   This was one of the main reasons that Satoshi Nakamoto created

> Bitcoin transaction records are totally open, and everyone can see every transaction.
(It’s hard to imagine that being the case in the offline banking world, but Bitcoin adheres
to the Net’s philosophy that everything should be open unless
 there is a great harm in making it open.)

>  In current practice, a Bitcoin wallet is not totally anonymous, as most of the Bitcoin exchanges are required by governments to provide
real-world identification when trying to cash out from the system.

> For example, this is a Bitcoin ATM. It was recently set up near
 where I live, so I stopped by to try it out. It requires government-issued ID,
  takes a photo of my face and palm print, and does phone verification via SMS.

  used for everyday transactions and deanonymization happens as
  a matter of course, users will have much less
   privacy than with cash or credit cards.

> Unfortunately, Bitcoin does not satisfy the untraceability requirement.

> Since all the transactions that take place between the network’s
participants are public, any transaction can be
 unambiguously traced to a unique origin and final recipient.

 > Bitcoin’s failure to satisfy the two properties outlined above
 leads us to conclude that it is not an anonymous but a

> The authors also worry that bitcoins used in merchant transactions can
 already be traced back to the exchange where the coins were purchased.

> Garzik argues that these features are not needed.
“A corporation that wishes for its finances to be auditable by the world
 at large will not want these proposed anonymity features,” he says,
  adding that pro-anonymity tools and services can be
   layered on top of the protocol. “Wouldn't it be wonderful if

 Or rather, Bitcoin's troubling lack of it.

> So what's the problem? The block chain is Bitcoin's greatest strength.
 Unfortunately from a privacy perspective, it's also the
 currency's greatest weakness.

> In a sense this makes Bitcoin less private than cash,
 and even worse than credit cards. If
  you choose to engage in sensitive transactions on Bitcoin,
   you should be aware that a record will be preserved for all eternity.

> Already several academic works have succeeded in
 de-anonymizing Bitcoin transactions. And this work

> While BitCoin developers have tried to make it clear
 that anonymity is not a feature that exists by design,
  it is something which appeals to many BitCoin users and is
   also one of the points that its opponents use to attack it.

> The problem is that it is actually very
 easy to build a profile of a BitCoin user and
  all of their transactions using a combination of the information
   that is actually available within the BitCoin network and
    by gathering publicly available information from off-network resources.

> As I have already said, it is not meant to be

> Technically the appropriate term is "pseudonymous" - imagine that your bitcoin address is like an email address
or an online alias: how hard it is to trace to your actions depend largely on what you do with it.

> It is considered pseudo-anonymous. With casual usage, it is not very anonymous at all.

> Bitcoin transactions can be traced back to your IP address.
 The history of all transactions can be analyzed for spatial and
  temporal correlations. If one address can be linked to a person,
   then related transactions can be identified.

> And, you have to know what you're doing to use
 it in complete anonymity. I would not advise using bitcoin if
  you are seeking complete anonymity.

#### [Bitcoin not so anonymous, Irish researcher says](http://www.dw.com/en/bitcoin-not-so-anonymous-irish-researcher-says/a-15276051) | Jun 2011

> Jeff Garzik, one of Bitcoin's primary developers,
has repeatedly told journalists: "Attempting major illicit transactions
 with Bitcoin, given existing statistical analysis
 techniques deployed in the field by law enforcement,
  is pretty damned dumb."

> The first is that the media often say that Bitcoin is anonymous,
 and I would say that anyone that works in the
  development of Bitcoin would agree that these reports are wrong.

> So it has this worrisome property that later
transactions can give you information about
the identity of the people that performed the earlier transactions.

> But untraceable transactions are not an inherent part of Bitcoin at
 this point, and given the architecture of the system
  they will probably never be, regardless of the importance
   the community puts on anonymity.

> There’s a common myth that Bitcoin is anonymous.

> Because your transactions can be linked together, some prefer
 to say that Bitcoin is at best pseudonymous.

> It’s possible for an investigator to put together enough information to get a decent idea of who you’re involved with and what you’re interested in buying, particularly if you’ve been involved in transactions with others who have made their Bitcoin address public.


#### [Why Bitcoin is not as anonymous as most users think](https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2011/07/bitcoin-is-not-inherently-anon.html) | Jul 2011

> People who use Bitcoin to ensure their purchases remain anonymous
may want to reconsider their reliance on the online peer-to-peer currency,
 say researchers who have investigated the network of Bitcoin transactions.

> Anyone can view every transaction, but since there is no public record linking
 addresses to users and users can have any number of addresses many
  people assumed it would not be possible to trace transactions to
   a particular individual. Now Fergal Reid and Martin Harrigan of University College Dublin,
    Ireland, say this assumption is wrong.

 of them may believe they are.



#### [Technology](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/cs181/projects/2010-11/DigitalCurrencies/technology/index.html) | Apr 2011

> Bitcoin addresses contain no personal information attached to it, and are somewhat anonymous.
However, it is still possible to track a user using transaction history, which is public to all users.

> If an address is connected to a user, it is possible to trace the series of transactions, and subsequently, track the user.


#### [Anonymity](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=241.0) | Jul 2010

> The current BitCoin implementation is certainly
better than using a credit card,
but I wouldn't use it in environments requiring strong
 anonymity without a lot of changes.

> The history of a coin is publicly available.
 Anyone can see the flow of BitCoins from address to address. This becomes a problem
  when certain points in the "transaction chain"
   become known to the attacker.

#### [Repost: How anonymous are bitcoins?](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=8.0) | Nov 2009

> The possibility to be anonymous or pseudonymous
relies on you not revealing any identifying information
about yourself in connection with the bitcoin addresses you use.

> If you post your bitcoin address on the web,
 then you're associating that address and any transactions
 with it with the name you posted under.
  If you posted under a handle that you haven't
   associated with your real identity, then you're still pseudonymous.
